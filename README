***Linear Discrimination With Perceptrons***

AUTHOR: Karl Hiner
INFO: HW1, CS 445, Machine Learning, Winter 2012.
DESCRIPTION: A perceptron to classify the handwritten number data at
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Optical+Recognition+of+Handwritten+Digits

USAGE:
> python perceptron.py --train=<training file> --test=<test file>

<training file> and <test file> are replaced with the names of the
training and test files, respectfully

NOTES:
With minor variations to code in perceptron.py, this perceptron is easily
generalizable to classify any data with features and classes encoded as
integers.

The data is expected to be in CSV format, with one line per instance,
where all integers in the line are features, except the last line, which
should be the class of the instance.
