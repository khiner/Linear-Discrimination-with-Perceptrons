***Linear Discrimination With Perceptrons***

DESCRIPTION:
A perceptron to classify the handwritten number data at
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Optical+Recognition+of+Handwritten+Digits
The perceptron trains on data in a user-specified training file
(defaulting to 'data/optdigits.tra') until the average accuracy for all
classes is no longer increasing, and then tests the trained weightings
on a user-specified test file (defaulting to 'data/optdigits.tes').

USAGE:
To use default parameters and defualt train/test files, simply run
> python perceptron.py

OPTIONS:
  -h, --help                            show help message and exit

  -n TRAIN_FILE, --train=TRAIN_FILE     file with training data.
                                        default: 'data/optdigits.tra'
  -t TEST_FILE, --test=TEST_FILE        file with test data.
                                        default: 'data/optdigits.tes'
  -e MAX_EPOCHS, --epochs=MAX_EPOCHS    maximum number of epochs.
                                        default: 10
  -r RATE, --rate=RATE                  learning rate. default: 0.2

NOTES:
With minor variations to code in perceptron.py, this perceptron is easily
generalizable to classify any data with features and classes encoded as
integers.

The data is expected to be in CSV format, with one line per instance,
where all integers in the line are features, except the last line, which
should be the class of the instance.
